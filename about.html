            The Full Stack Development Immersive is designed to take individuals with little to no programming experience and make them successful software developers. The program consists of 16, 1-unit semester equivalent courses and 4, 2-unit semester equivalent courses for a total program length of 30 weeks. The student workload for this program is a minimum of 1080 hours, where 360 hours is dedicated to contact work or instruction and 720 hours or more of outside study or preparation.

            The term “Full Stack” means that students will be working with every layer in the “stack” of a typical web application: user interface, front end (browser), middle tier, and back end (server and database). The program has a deep emphasis on the most popular current web technology languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Python. It will also cover many peripheral tools, technologies and methodologies such as GitHub and Agile as the students are working through the material.
            
            The term “immersive” is in reference to the delivery style. Students will be building websites and applications as they work through each week of the program. These sites and programs will start out as relatively simple single page websites, to fully functioning web applications with integrations to external data sources and mobile app capability. At the end of the program, students will build applications using everything they have learned throughout the program in a setting that will reflect a typical web startup or technology department at a large company. They will leave the program having deployed a fully functioning web company that is live on the web and accessible through a mobile device.
            
            The program is taught 100% online in the English language.
